#Iron
##This is Citrus' internal frontend design system and style library

##Why "Iron" - The periodic table of elements symbol for iron is `Fe`, short for the Latin ferrum, literally translated as "holy metal" - we can get behind that. Not to mention, `FE` is typically used to shorten "frontend" in web development, and this library helps us build the frontend of Citrus - one of the pillars of Citrus is an exceptional end-to-end experience for our users. The visual and interactive consistency between disparate surface areas (tvOS, web...) of our company starts here and ends with the user's experience. Let's do this!
